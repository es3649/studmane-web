                Waters, calm and serene
                <br>Reflecting the skies, and mountain forests green
                <br>In the choppy waves from the wind,
                <br>In the peaceful waves of my friends.
            </p>
            
            <p class="center-text" >
                A droplet falls; a ripple forms:
                <br>A clear reflected picture torn.
                <br>This swell, a rising ripple-wave,
                <br>Why can't these waters just behave?
            </p>
            
            <p class="center-text" >
                The seasons turn and colors change
                <br>Bashful yellows, reds of rage.
                <br>The image of snow-capped mountains falters
                <br>In ever more troubled waters.
            </p>
               
            <p class="center-text" >
                How did one drop start all this mess?
                <br>How does hope cause such unrest?
                <br>A need for something more than life
                <br>A faint touch of some foreign light.
            </p>
            
            <p class="center-text" >
                The rising swells become a storm
                <br>But in the danger something warm
                <br>Water churns with passion surging
                <br>Some great power is onward urging
                <br>To action. To action! The foaming cry
                <br>Before the hopes can pass you by.
            </p>
            
            <p class="center-text" >
                Or else.
                <br>Or else...
            </p>
            
            <p class="center-text" >
                Those peaceful days will come again, 
                <br>Among the choppy waves of friends
                <br>With nothing magical to see.
                <br>Soft reflections, solemnly.
            </p>
