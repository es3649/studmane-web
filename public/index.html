                    My name is <b>Eric Steadman</b>. I'm 21, and I was raised in Orem, Utah. 
                    I'm a senior in the Mathematics program, minoring in Computer Science, at 
                    <a href="https://byu.edu/">Brigham Young University</a>. I like cooking,
                    photography, writing poetry. I enjoy proving things,
                    and I like to get in over my head and figure out things which are above my level.
                    I frequently find myself researching things in my free time. I also feel an innate
                    desire te be a cultured individual, so I've dedicated myself to traveling, reading,
                    and learning languages. I speak Spanish fluently, my Portuguese is on its way, and 
                    I just started studying Chinese.
