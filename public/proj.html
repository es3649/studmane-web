            <h2>Description</h2>
            <code>proj</code> is a command line tool designed to make command line
            development more efficient. I live my life in the shell. <code>proj</code>
            is for everyone who, like me, believes that <i>real</i> development tools
            include only the shell, and maybe a nice editor like VSCode.

            <h2>Commands</h2>

            <div class="command">
                <h3><code>init</code></h3>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>init</code> initializes a new workspace. Subcommands are provided
                    to initialize java and c++ projects specifically. New directories are
                    created which are often used in projects, including folders for source 
                    code, tools, compiled binaries, external libraries, documentation, and 
                    so forth. It also creates a path modifier, allowing project tools to be 
                    used universally, and a language specific Makefile, which relies on the
                    pre-generated tools in the tools directory to get work done.
                </p>
                
                <p class="indent">
                    This command also supplies the <code>-g</code> flag, allowing Github integration. 
                    <code>proj</code> local resources contain a Github OAuth token, allowing it to initialize a
                    new repository remotely, as well as to locally.
                    This integration will likely be done using Google's
                    <a href="https://github.com/google/go-github">go-github</a> library.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="command">
                <h3><code>class</code></h3>
                <p class="indent">
                    <code>class</code> creates and formats a new blank class file.
                </p>

                <p class="indent">
                    In c++ projects, this command creates a pair of files, a '.cpp' and a '.h'.
                    In java and go projects, package names will be inferred and auto generated.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="command">
                <h3><code>mv</code></h3>
                <p class="indent">
                    This command moves files and directories while respecting references
                    to that file/directory in other files. In java and go files, this includes
                    respect to package names within files.
                </p>

                <p class="indent">
                    This move is also done with respect to <code>git</code>, so that files are
                    'moved' with respect to version control, instead of deleted and re-added. The
                    real purpose for this is that I think the latter is messy, even though
                    implementing the former method is a pain.

                    This project, as well as its design, is still in progress.
                    Other commands will be implemented as the need arises. To suggest new

                <code>~/.proj_config</code> stores configurations for the <code>proj</code> tool,
                as well as resources needed for class generation. Later, command line integration
                may be added to enable config modification at execution time, but as is, configs
                can only be edited by modifying them directly withing the <code>.proj_config</code>
                folder.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                This <code>.proj_config</code> resource file, contains sub-directories for each
                suported language. Each language defines a <code>manifest.json</code>, which 
                declares which directories will be created, and which resource files will be
                copied upon initialization. The manifest references resource files based on their
                relative locaiton to the manifest. 
                <br>Each Language also declares custom class file templates, which are used when
                executing the <code>class</code> command. They also define a <code>messages.json</code>
